# simple_shell
In this repository you will find the entire project where we built our own version of a Shell, when you clone this to your shell . Originally created for learning purposes in the Holberton School, Barranquilla campus - cohort 13.

By learning how the shell works you will be able to understand how some of the CLI works, how do they receive instructions, how do they read the instructions, how do they interpret and create a process according to the instruction given and of course, since this is a project built in C language, we need to handle carefully the memory, so we will have enough memory to run the process we want or if that's the case, print an error among others managements. We hope this to be useful and clear for any who is in this same path on learning and becoming to be a great software developer.
